(1) First version - After discussion, we finalized to go with only Indian banks. As we have few listed banks in India which went bankrupt in past, we can get a decent classifier for our data.

We used balancesheets for Indian banks, we got from screener.in.
It has 10 parameters - Share Capital, Reserves, Borrowings, Other Liabilities, Total Liabilities, Fixed Assets, CWIP, Investments, Other Assets, Total Assets. 

There are few issues with this data:
1. This was yearly data, as one year is preety long time and a we might miss the correct timings for prediction, we decided to use quarterly data for next time.
2. Correlation with other parameters is very high, so we decided to use PCA to reduce the dimensions.
3. Few of the parameters are in absoulte terms such as Total assets or revnue, and this was creating a problem for model. So we decided to use relative terms such as % of total assets or revenue.
4. Overall performace for model was not great, so we decided to look into relevant and publicly available data variables other than balancesheets.

(2) The new parameters we are planning to use are: Net NPA, Net interest margin, Loan to assets ration, Return on assests ration, CASA ration, Capital Adequency Ratio. Why this ratios are important is explained in ppt in Additional parameters folder.
